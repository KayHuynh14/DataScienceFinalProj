This is Part A â€“ Problem: Predicting Airplane Delays with basic model
In this part, I will read, clean and process the flight data.
Then build basic model to train and predict data.

After that, I add more features about weather and holidays to data.
Then resample data and train, test data again.

This is part B - Predicting Airplane Delays with Amazone SageMaker
In this part, I will import data from part A, then train and test data with xgboost estimator.


The result are:
- Clean flight data for machine learning
- Linear Regression models
- Results from training model 1 and model 2
- Results from training model with xgboost estimator
